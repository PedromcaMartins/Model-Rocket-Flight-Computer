# Motivation 

This repository is the result of an ongoing project to develop a Model Rocket, while learning from many fields of engineering I find interesting. 

My background is in Computer Science, and I've got 2 years of experience designing software for a rocket team @RED, Portugal. 
I want to challenge myself by using Rust, a language I've been learning since 2024, for the flight computer, and some of the Ground-station stack, if not all... 

I also want to take this opportunity to learn more about designing model rocket design / simulator, get experience with CAD modeling by modeling and 3d printing parts for the model rocket, electronics and PCB design, and eventually control algorithms :)
